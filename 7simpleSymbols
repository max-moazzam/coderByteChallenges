//Function that takes in a string and returns true or false.
//If the string has each of its letters surrounded by a +,
//Then a true result is returned, if not then false.
//The function assumes that at least one letter is entered.

//The function works by looping through the string parameter,
//And looping through the alphabet and checking to see if there,
//Is a match, if there is a match and the character before and after,
//Is a +, then a true result is inputted into an array.
//Furthermore, if a character is not in the alphabet then a true,
//Result is inputted. False is only inputted if an alphabet,
//Character is matched and there is not a + before or after it.
//A final loop is made to check through this new array,
//And if all the elements in the array are true, then true is returned,
//And false otherwise.
