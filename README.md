# coderByteChallenges
Collection of challenges done on the Coder Byte Website

<h2>Info</h2>
These are a collection of programs/functions created to complete the Coder Byte Challenges, all done on JavaScript.

Although there are better ways to complete some of the challenges, I have elected to keep all my code as original
rather than improve them after viewing someone elses code. I chose this to show how I approach and complete problems.

After I have finished all of the easy challenges I plan on going back and redoing the challenges in a different repository
with my newfound experience, to create better and more efficient, elegant code.
